# AuroraExtended

Replacement for Lib. Will open every Aurora window at the start of the game and hide them from the user, keeping them synced throughout the game.
This allows patches to operate directly on Aurora forms, retrieving information from and interacting with them without being visible to the user.
Also has some other handy functions, such as adding buttons to the TacticalMap, easy event hooks for when the user increments time, etc.
